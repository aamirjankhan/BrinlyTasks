A superb number is an integer which is less than the sum of
its proper divisors, excluding itself. Thus, 12 is a superb number because
1, 2, 3, and 6 are its proper positive divisors and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12.
The next superb number is 18 < 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9.
The next two superb numbers are 20 and 24.
Write a function called superb that returns true if
the argument passed to it is a superb number and false otherwise.
